1. Introduction                                       *gh-review-introduction*

gh-review.vim is a Vim 9.0+ plugin for reviewing GitHub pull requests.  It
provides side-by-side diffs, review thread viewing and commenting, commit
suggestions, and review submission -- all driven by the `gh` CLI.

The goal of this plugin is to provide the simplest means possible for
performing GitHub PR reviews.  It is designed for the use case where you
have already identified a specific PR or PR branch you are ready to review.
Anything beyond that is a non-goal -- for example, GitHub Issues,
Notifications, Discussions, Actions, PR listing, or label/assignee/reviewer
management.  You are expected to perform those tasks using other tooling.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements                                       *gh-review-requirements*

- Vim 9.0 or later (with |vim9script| support)
- `gh` CLI (https://cli.github.com), authenticated
- A git repository with a GitHub remote

==============================================================================
3. Workflows                                             *gh-review-workflows*

The plugin has two main workflows.

CHECKOUT WORKFLOW ~
                                                  *gh-review-checkout-workflow*

The checkout workflow is typically used by a project maintainer reviewing a
contributor’s PR.  The branch is checked out locally so the reviewer can
make edits, commit fixes, and push directly.

Use |:GHReview| with no argument (auto-detects the PR from the current
branch), a PR number, or a URL that refers to the same repo as the current
working directory.

- If the current branch already matches the PR’s head ref, the plugin
  skips the checkout prompt and loads the UI immediately.
- Otherwise, the plugin prompts to check out the branch.  On confirmation,
  the branch is fetched and checked out, and push tracking is configured
  automatically (for both same-repo and fork PRs).
- The right/head diff buffer is editable: |:w| writes to the working tree.
  External file changes (e.g., from another editor or `git stash pop`) are
  detected via mtime tracking, and the plugin prompts to reload.
- `git push` pushes changes back to the PR branch with no extra flags.

If you decline the checkout, or the checkout fails (e.g., dirty working
tree), the plugin falls back to the no-checkout workflow.

NO-CHECKOUT WORKFLOW ~
                                               *gh-review-no-checkout-workflow*

The no-checkout workflow is more typical of a non-maintainer reviewer who only
needs to read the diff and leave comments.

Use |:GHReview| with a URL that refers to a different repo than the current
working directory.  This workflow also activates as a fallback when a checkout
is declined or fails.

- No checkout is offered or attempted.
- Diff content is fetched via the GitHub API.
- The right/head diff buffer is read-only.
- Comments, suggestions, and review submission all work normally.

A quick-start sequence for either workflow: >

    :GHReview 123           Open PR #123 (or :GHReview {url})
    <CR>                    Open a file’s side-by-side diff
    ]t / [t                 Jump between review threads
    gt                      View a thread
    gc                      Add a comment
    :GHReviewStart          Start a pending review (optional)
    :GHReviewSubmit         Submit the review
    :GHReviewClose          Close all review buffers
<
==============================================================================
4. Commands                                               *gh-review-commands*

                                                                   *:GHReview*
:GHReview               With no argument, detect the PR from the current
                        branch via `gh pr view`.

:GHReview {number}      Open a pull request by number.

:GHReview {url}         Open a pull request by GitHub URL.  If the URL’s
                        repo matches the local `origin` remote, the checkout
                        workflow is used; otherwise the no-checkout workflow.

                        See |gh-review-workflows| for details on when the
                        branch is checked out and when it is not.

                                                              *:GHReviewFiles*
:GHReviewFiles          Toggle the changed files list buffer.

                                                              *:GHReviewStart*
:GHReviewStart          Start a pending review.  All subsequent comments will
                        be held as pending until the review is submitted.
                        This is optional; |:GHReviewSubmit| works without it.
                        If a pending review already exists on the PR (from a
                        previous session or the GitHub web UI), it is detected
                        automatically and reused.

                                                             *:GHReviewSubmit*
:GHReviewSubmit         Submit a review.  Prompts for the review action
                        (Comment, Approve, or Request changes) and an optional
                        body.  If a pending review is active, it is submitted;
                        otherwise a review is created and submitted in one
                        step.

                                                            *:GHReviewDiscard*
:GHReviewDiscard        Discard the pending review.  Prompts for confirmation,
                        then deletes the review and all its pending comments.

                                                              *:GHReviewClose*
:GHReviewClose          Close all review buffers and reset plugin state.

==============================================================================
5. Diff View                                             *gh-review-diff-view*

The diff view shows two vertically split buffers in Vim’s native diff mode:
the left buffer shows the base version (at the merge base commit) and the
right buffer shows the head version (at the PR’s head commit).

In the checkout workflow, the right buffer is editable.  |:w| writes to the
working tree, and external file changes are detected automatically.  If the
file changes on disk (e.g., from another editor), the plugin prompts to
reload.

In the no-checkout workflow, the right buffer is read-only.

DIFF MAPPINGS ~
                                                    *gh-review-diff-mappings*

gt                      Open the review thread at the cursor line.
gc                      Create a new comment at the cursor line.
                        In visual mode, creates a multi-line comment.
gs                      Create a suggestion at the cursor line (right buffer
                        only).  In visual mode, creates a multi-line
                        suggestion.
]t                      Jump to the next review thread sign.
[t                      Jump to the previous review thread sign.
gf                      Toggle the files list.
q                       Close the diff view, returning to the files list.

==============================================================================
6. Signs                                                   *gh-review-signs*

Review threads are indicated by signs in the sign column of diff buffers:

CT                      Comment thread (blue).  The most recent comment has
                        state COMMENTED.
CR                      Resolved thread (green).
CP                      Pending thread (yellow).  The thread contains a
                        comment from the current pending review.

Signs are placed on the appropriate side (left or right buffer) depending on
the thread’s diff side.  For outdated threads where the line number is no
longer valid, the sign falls back to the original line number.

Use `]t` and `[t` to jump between signs.

==============================================================================
7. Thread Buffer                                     *gh-review-thread-buffer*

The thread buffer opens in a bottom split showing the thread’s code context,
comments, and a reply area: >

    Thread on src/main.rs:42  [Active]
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
      42 + | let x = foo();
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    alice (2025-01-15):
      Looks good

    -- Reply below (Ctrl-S to submit, Ctrl-R to resolve, Ctrl-Q to cancel) --

<
The area above the separator is read-only.  The area below is the reply
editor.

THREAD MAPPINGS ~
                                                  *gh-review-thread-mappings*

CTRL-S                  Submit the reply text (below the separator line).
CTRL-R                  Resolve or unresolve the thread.
q                       Close the thread buffer.
CTRL-Q                  Close the thread buffer (works in insert mode too).

The thread buffer uses |'buftype'| `acwrite`, so |:w| also submits the reply.

==============================================================================
8. Files List                                           *gh-review-files-list*

The files list opens in a bottom split showing changed files with their
diff stats and thread counts: >

    https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123: Fix the widget
    Files changed (3)

      +12 -3   M  src/main.rs         [2 threads]
      +45 -0   A  src/new_file.rs
      +0  -22  D  src/old_file.rs
<
Mappings:

<CR>                    Open side-by-side diff for the file under cursor.
q                       Close the files list.
gf                      Close the files list (same as q).
R                       Refresh review threads from GitHub.
